Don't despise humble beginnings, they're the only ways to really begin.

What are some of the reasons you think we should program our solutions nowadays?

If you've got battles, you need arsenals.
If you've got problems, you need tools and skills.
At this age, if your physical problems aren't abstracted computationally, then, they are not yet problems; they are just mere observations from you as a Spectator, simply because you won't ever amount to solving them with the dividends of accuracy, speed, flexibility, and optimization exclusive to compuatational science. Rather, we already know our problems, we only need those that can lend them to be solved with the best tools available. So, if you think you just solved a problem today using the tools of yesterday, no, you rather solved a problem in the past, and who cares about that, except the person who is yet to see the problem being solved with today's tools, and that means the problem (as far as the expectation of people from their magnified lens of today's and even tomorrow's technologies is concerned) is yet to be solved.
So, I can't overemphasize your need to be compuatational, in a globalized world where computational prowess is what means you can hear (data is speaking, are you listening and inferring), be heard, and understood globally (by humans and devices).
